# home_ota

An app that uses AI to make it more accessable to aid homeless people. Users can use the app to interview homeless people by recording their conversations. Using NLP, we can determine skills and medical conditions a homeless person may have so that the right people can raech out to them. Also, after the interview the homeless person may sign his/her name to be ID'd and have that data mapped to them using image recognition. Prediction is also done to determine current capacity of local homeless shelters based on current weather, temperature, etc..
